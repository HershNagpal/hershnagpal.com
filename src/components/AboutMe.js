                The engineer is the gallbladder of their team. No one really understands it's <br/>
                function. It's a humble and hardworking organ that's not very glamorous to <br/>
                think about. You could probably live without it but it definitely makes your <br/>
                life easier behind the scenes. <br/>

                I'm an artist and software engineering student. I have been a gallbladder for <br/>
                a few years now and I love to bring my hobbies and interests into my field. <br/>
                This website is my way of sharing my combination of nostalgic art style and <br/>
                love for engineering with you.<br/>
