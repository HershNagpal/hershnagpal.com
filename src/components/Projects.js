            <p>
                I grew up in the early 2000's when Windows XP was the dominant operating<br/>
                system of choice in home computers. Our old Compaq monitor and nameless<br/>
                PC left a lasting nostalgic impression on my life that I wouldn't tap into<br/>
                again until I reached college.

                In my freshman year, I discovered my love for the feelings brought back by<br/>
                the vaporwave style of art and music. Despite how abrasive (ugly) and abstract<br/>
                (senseless) it looks, vaporwave style art feels like living in a fantasy world<br/>
                of the retro technology I grew up with.               
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is my way of sharing the nostalgia with you. Built with React.js,<br/>
                hosted on AWS.
